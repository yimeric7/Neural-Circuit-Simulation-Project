# Neural Circuit Simulation Project v1
The first iterations of this project are meant to develop a base model that incorporates the various control centers of the brain into circuits that a user can interface with to understand neurological processes. Over time, computational and neurological advancements may be incorporated into new iterations of the project to transform it into a more versatile tool that can be used across various fields. The development of software that can simulate neural circuits in the human brain can have wide applications. There is a constant stream of information being processed and relayed in the brain. This information can be broken down into various components. For example, auditory stimulation, visual stimulation, tactile/touch stimulation, and olfactory stimulation to name a few. To make sense of this constant stream of stimuli, the brain evolutionarily developed specialized processing centers. Some of these centers include the amygdala, the auditory cortex, the visual cortex, the olfactory cortex, and the primary somatosensory cortex among others. Each processing center is specialized for its specific stimulus and furthermore, each center relays information to other areas of the brain for further processing.

## Technologies
This will be built using Three js, React Three Fiber, React Three Drei, and vite. This project will be published in the near future, but in the meantime, it can only be ran locally.
To run the project locally, run the following commands:   
1. cd project-folder
2. npm install    
3. npm run dev
