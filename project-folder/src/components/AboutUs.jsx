                    We're a team of custom web application developers who thought our process could be streamlined. So we started building an internal tool. Thus, we came up with FireJet.

                    After developing and delivering custom web applications for several clients, we found ourselves in an iterative process of designing the user interface, developing the frontend, the backend, and then deploying to cloud.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Internally, we wanted to streamline this process, starting with EzBackend, a backend framework that serves as an ease-of-use wrapper over Fastify and TypeORM. We then considered the possibility of extending this to a frontend framework as well, but realised that existing frameworks were already serving the need well.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    So what was left? Design to Code.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Hence, we have decided to make FireJet as an internal tool that will allow us to bridge the gap between design and frontend. But as we started developing FireJet for internal use, we wondered if it could possibly be useful to other developers, or even non-developers? If you are interested and believe FireJet could be useful to you as well, please let us know by signing up. Thank you!
